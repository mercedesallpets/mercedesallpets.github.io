				<h2>About</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Hi! My name is Mercedes and I've had animals around me all my life. I currently own two hens, 4 tortoises and one cat. All adopted by accident but I love them with all my heart. I have owned dogs, rabbits, hamsters and singing birds in
				the past as well!</p>
			<p>I am from Spain but I have been living in the UK for the last 10 years and I'm totally in love with this country.
				I used to be a primary school teacher in Berkshire but in the past few years I realised that I want to spend as much time as I can doing what I really love, which is looking after animals and being outdoors.</p>
			<p>If you don't have enough time to provide your pets the attention that you would like, I can help you with this. From your point of view, I just want to make your life easier. Whether it's walking your dog, looking after your hens while you
				are away or spending some time playing with your cat. Please have a look at the services I provide and if you think I can help, don't hesitate to get in touch!</p>
